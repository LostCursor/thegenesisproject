# The Genesis Project
## A project about making a game inside a webcomic an actual game

### The Story So Far
There’s this really cool dude, ok? He's standing around being all chill, like cool dudes are known to do sometimes. A cool dude like this probably has a real cool name. But he probably wouldn't just tell you what it was if you asked, because you could see it right on your screen. His name is LostCursor. He’s pretty cool. His other self, Nemesis, is also pretty cool. One day, he was bored and proposed an idea to make Sburb an actual game. He published design pages, and r/Homestuck liked them. They liked them so much, they decided to make it an actual project.

### Getting a development environment set up
Steps:
* [Grab Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) and install it. You'll need to register for a Unity account if you don't have one already.
* [Download Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and install it. If you already have Git installed, all you have to do is install Git LFS for asset tracking.
  You can get Git LFS [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
* Clone this repo. As previously stated, you'll need Git LFS to properly clone and track assets. If you don't have a lot of git experience, we recommend using Github Desktop to do this.

You can now open the `The Genesis Project/` Unity project.
When you make changes, commit them with Github Desktop unless you know what you're doing.

If you're making substantial changes, make them on a new branch and submit a pull request. Erin will review and merge that when you're done.
