# The Genesis Project
## A project about making a game inside a webcomic an actual game

### The Story So Far
There’s this really cool dude, ok? He's standing around being all chill, like cool dudes are known to do sometimes. A cool dude like this probably has a real cool name. But he probably wouldn't just tell you what it was if you asked, because you could see it right on your screen. His name is LostCursor. He’s pretty cool. His other self, Nemesis, is also pretty cool. One day, he was bored and proposed an idea to make Sburb an actual game. He published design pages, and r/Homestuck liked them. They liked them so much, they decided to make it an actual project.

*TODO: add dev env setup stuff here*
